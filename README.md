# Open_CV_Practice

The final project is located in final_project.py within the Open_CV_Practice folder. Requirements are:
Chapter 3 - loading files from command prompt
Chapter 4 & 8 - changing color of a section of the image using a mask 
Chapter 6 - cropping a section of the image
Chapter 7 - get color histogram for hsv image
Chapter 9 - creates a cool glitchy image using a threshold
Chapter 10 & 11 - find and display contours

Unfinished project was the original idea for the OpenCV final project, but I did not finish it because I couldn't figure out how to better contour the red box when the background was so messy. Hopefully, I'll be able to come back to it.
